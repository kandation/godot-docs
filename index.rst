Welcome to Godot Engine's documentation!
========================================

**Note:** Godot Engine is an open source project developed by a community of volunteers.
It means that the documentation team can always use your feedback and help to improve our
tutorials and class reference. So if you don't manage to understand something, or can't find
what you are looking for in the docs, help us make the documentation better and let us know!
Submit an issue `to the GitHub repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues>`_,
or annoy us at the #godotengine-devel IRC channel!
